I've put this up at blog.atlantas.com.au.

In trivial.arc change the addresses of the posts, header and footer file to your location: postdir*, headerfile*, footerfile*
Put any number of posts (text files) you like in the posts directory.
Run trivial.arc like any other arc file and then run asv. Then look at http://localhost:8080

(load "trivial.arc")
(asv)

Notes:
* Changed the address of the css file in header.htmlf from
href="/static/css/webapp.css" to href="/webapp.css".  I'm using trivial.arc to generate the
css page.
* Removed "<!DOCTYPE html>" from SM's header.htmlf. The CSS wasn't showing otherwise.
